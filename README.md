## ➤ Getting Started

If you are interested in using this bot, you need to know a few things!

## ➤ How to use webhook on your room

Follow these steps to connect your room to your Discord server to show logs and send match replays

1. Create your Discord server or use one where you have admin rights
2. Create a channel for logs (with permissions only for admins) and one for replays
3. For each channel, create a [webhook](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) and copy their links
4. Replace `CHANGEWEBHOOK` by the webhook link of your log/replay channel
